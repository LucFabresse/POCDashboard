# Why this repo?

Main question: Which technologies / architecture to develop a dashboard that displays various sensors data and also support controlling some actuators (pumps)?

Are there no-code / low-Code solutions?

Constraints:
- Web-based
- dynamic updates (the dashboard updates itself when new values arrive)
